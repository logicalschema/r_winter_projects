1. Data Exploration: This should include summary statistics, means, medians, quartiles, or any other relevant information about the data set. Please include some conclusions in the R Markdown text.

``` {r}
require(plyr)

gssData <- read.csv('GSSvocab.csv',header=TRUE, sep=",")
summary(gssData)

```

Conclusions: Some conclusions from the data: 1) the percentage of women who participated in the study was `r round((16385/(12482 + 16385))* 100, 2)` percent and 2) the number of participants who identified as native born was 26,224 in comparison with no's: 2,556 and NA's: 87.

2. Data wrangling: Please perform some basic transformations. They will need to make sense but could include column renaming, creating a subset of the data, replacing values, or creating new columns with derived data (for example â€“ if it makes sense you could sum two columns together)
